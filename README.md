# 📊 Comparative Analysis of Feedforward, Convolutional, and Recurrent Neural Networks on Dataset Performance

## 📄 Overview

This project focuses on implementing and comparing three neural network models: **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**, **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, and **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. The analysis covers each model's architecture, preprocessing techniques, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings aim to provide insights into model selection for different types of datasets and applications.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Implement and compare FNN, CNN, and RNN models.
- Automate data preprocessing for each model.
- Ensure data accuracy through cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Evaluate models using performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Provide reusable scripts for future neural network projects.
- Analyze results for applications in image recognition, sequence processing, and predictive analytics.
